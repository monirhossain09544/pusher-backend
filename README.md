# Real-time Notifications Backend with Pusher

## Overview

This document provides instructions for setting up a Node.js backend server that integrates with Pusher to send real-time notifications to a Flutter application. The backend is capable of broadcasting messages to any subscribed clients via Pusher Channels.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Pusher account with an app created on the Pusher Dashboard.
- Node.js and npm installed on your server.
- A Flutter app with Pusher client integration.

### Installation

1. Clone or download the backend server code from the repository.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/monirhossain09544/pusher-backend.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the root directory of the backend server code in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.

### Configuration

Configure the backend with your Pusher app credentials. These can be found in your Pusher dashboard under the "App Keys" section.

1. Open the `server.js` file in a text editor.
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Pusher app credentials:

```javascript
const pusher = new Pusher({
  appId: "YOUR_PUSHER_APP_ID",
  key: "YOUR_PUSHER_APP_KEY",
  secret: "YOUR_PUSHER_APP_SECRET",
  cluster: "YOUR_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER",
  useTLS: true
});
Usage
Running the Server
Start the server by executing:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
The server will listen for incoming HTTP POST requests to trigger notifications.

Triggering Notifications
Send a POST request to the /notify endpoint with a JSON payload containing the message. This can be done using tools like Postman or via curl:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"message\":\"Your notification message\"}" http://<YOUR_SERVER_URL>:3000/notify
Replace <YOUR_SERVER_URL> with the actual URL of your server.

Flutter App Integration
On the Flutter app side, you must subscribe to the Pusher channel and event to listen for messages. For more information, refer to the Pusher Channels documentation and the pusher_websocket_flutter package documentation.

Example Flutter subscription:

dart
Copy code
void initPusher() async {
  await Pusher.init("YOUR_PUSHER_APP_KEY", PusherOptions(cluster: "YOUR_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER"));
  Pusher.connect();

  Channel channel = await Pusher.subscribe("notification-channel");
  channel.bind("new-notification", (PusherEvent event) {
    // Handle the notification
    print(event.data);
  });
}
Security
For production environments, it is critical to secure your Pusher implementation:

Use environment variables to store sensitive keys and secrets.
Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to your endpoints.
Employ SSL/TLS encryption for data in transit.
Support
If you encounter any issues or require assistance, consult the Pusher documentation or contact Pusher support for help.
